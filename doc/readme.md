Please include these deliverables in the doc folder of your project 4.
* (0.5) Include the extended state machine model from a future in-class group activity. (Minimally, a cell phone scan of your drawing is acceptable.)
* (0.25) Use inline comments to document design details in the code.
* (0.25) Add javadoc comments to document how to use the abstractions (interfaces, classes) you designed. You will not have to create javadoc HTML.
* Include a brief (300-500 words) report containing this information:
 * (0.5) Your Group development journey during this project. Focus on aspects you find noteworthy, e.g., process, pairing, testing, design decisions, refactoring, use of the repository.
 * (0.5) The relationship between your extended state machine model from this project and your actual code. Possible talking points are:
 * What are the similarities and differences between model and code?
 * Is it more effective to code or model first?
 * Now that you have code, what, if any, changes would you make to your model?
